\section{Overview}

Websites have become highly interactive and contain more collaborative features which are enabled by new ways of client-server and client-client communication. In many use-cases it is no longer sufficient to simply display static sites, because other users may already have edited the content on these sites and the displayed information is rendered outdated. Clients need to be notified about these changes and reload parts of the website so that the displayed information matches the most recent version of the data.

This chapter will give an overview of old and new techniques for data exchange. Both their advantages and disadvantages shall be discussed in order to evaluate which technology will be used in particular parts of the implementation of the collaborative editor.
