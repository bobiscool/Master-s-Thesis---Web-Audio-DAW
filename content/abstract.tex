\noindent \textbf{Abstract}

\noindent The constant innovation in browser technology has shaped the web application landscape a lot in recent years. Applications have become more interactive, offer productive work environments and have increased the user interaction immensely. Collaborative work environments like Google Docs show, that web applications are perfectly suited as a collaborative platform. The Web Audio API is a novel technology that allows to process and to generate audio data right in the browser. This thesis describes the prototypical development of a collaborative web-based Digital Audio Workstation. It goes into the details of audio programming and shows recent research results in the field of synchronization algorithms. One of these algorithms is used for an application-wide synchronization mechanism that allows users to work on song arrangements collaboratively. The audio editor supports basic modules that are also part of other contemporay DAWs. It is shown how the Web Audio API can be used to build these important audio modules. Furthermore, high-performance scheduling algorithms have been implemented and are explained in detail.
